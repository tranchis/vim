			VimIOS -- A port of Vim to iOS 9+
							*ios*

Disclaimer: This is a side project of mine - no promises and no warranties. If
you like it, feel free to let me know, and please feel free to improve on it,
there is a lot to do.

This project is based on the [Vim port of
applidium](https://github.com/applidium/Vim), which has been inactive for a
few years. Nonetheless, it is a full, working port of Vim. However, in the
meantime iOS has gained many features of which this port did not take
advantage. I rewrote large parts of it with the goal of improving the Vim experience
under iOS 9, in particular on iPads with an external keyboard. 

The new key features are:
* Split View and Slide Over support
* Full external keyboard support
* Importing and exporting files from Vim to other apps is now possible. 
* Vim now looks great on retina displays.

==============================================================================
1. Usage

Open the app and just start typing. If you have an external keyboard, you
should be all set. If you need `<ESC>`, or `<F1>`, longpress anywhere on the
screen. Instead of `<ESC>`, you can also use `<C-[>`, which should be
available on most iPad keyboards.. 

You can get this help by using the command `:help ios`.


FILE MANAGEMENT				*ios_file_management*

This version of Vim comes with a version of the netrw file browser. Use the
command `e .` to start it. You will likely see the following items:


.vim/
Inbox/
.viminfo
.vimrc

If `.vimrc` does not exist, you can create it, if you wish. 

You can write files anywhere, except for the `Inbox/` folder, see below.
Use `<F1>` to get help on how to use the file browser. You can create
directories with `d` and delete directories/files with `D`. 


THE INBOX FOLDER				*inbox*

This is a special folder. Files imported from other applications will be saved
there. 

**You cannot save to the Inbox folder manually**.

In particular, if you import a file and make changes, then you *have* to save
the new file somewhere outside the Inbox folder.


IMPORTING FILES FROM OTHER APPLICATIONS		*importing* *airdrop*

If you would like to edit a file in Vim that is currently in the sandbox of
another application (e.g. the brilliant [Working
Copy](http://workingcopyapp.com)), simply go to this app and use standard iOS
dialog "Open in another app". Pick VimIOS, the file will be copied to the
VimIOS sandbox, and Vim will be opened.

**Important**: The file will be imported and saved into the directory `Inbox`.
If you want to make changes to this file, you **have** to save it outside the
`Inbox` directory.  This process also works with files shared via Airdrop.


EXPORTING FILES TO OTHER APPLICATIONS		*exporting* *:Share* *:Mail*

I added two commands to commands to Vim which allow you to export files. 

a. `:Share` opens the standard iOS dialog "Open in other app". You can also
export your file via Airdrop.
b. `:Mail` opens a slightly different dialog, which allows you to export your
text as the body of an email. 

==============================================================================

2. Customization

In the `.vim` folder (create it, if it doesn't exist), you can add plugins and
colorschemes as usual. I have not tested many plugins; obviously many plugins utilizing
features external to Vim will not work, as iOS does not provide a shell
to Vim.

==============================================================================

3. Todo

It would be very nice to implement the iOS document picker feature introduced
in iOS 8, which would allow Vim to open files directly from the sandbox of a
(compatible) app, such as several cloud storage providers. Unfortunately, this
has to be implemented by someone with an  Apple Developer subscription, as
access to CloudKit is necessary.
Also note that this would require the implementation of an at least
rudimentary document management system, as the document picker extension works
with the UIDocument class.
